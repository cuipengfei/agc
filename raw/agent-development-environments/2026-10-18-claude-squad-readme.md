## README 关键段落（按 ADE 判断关键词筛选，保留原文，完整段落边界）

[Claude Squad](https://smtg-ai.github.io/claude-squad/) is a terminal app that manages multiple [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (and other local agents including [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)) in separate workspaces, allowing you to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Highlights
- Complete tasks in the background (including yolo / auto-accept mode!)
- Manage instances and tasks in one terminal window
- Review changes before applying them, checkout changes before pushing them
- Each task gets its own isolated git workspace, so no conflicts

  -h, --help             help for claude-squad
  -p, --program string   Program to run in new instances (e.g. 'aider --model ollama_chat/gemma3:1b')
```

##### Instance/Session Management
- `n` - Create a new session
- `N` - Create a new session with a prompt
- `D` - Kill (delete) the selected session
- `↑/j`, `↓/k` - Navigate between sessions

##### Actions
- `↵/o` - Attach to the selected session to reprompt
- `ctrl-q` - Detach from session
- `s` - Commit and push branch to github
- `c` - Checkout. Commits changes and pauses the session
- `r` - Resume a paused session
- `?` - Show help menu

##### Navigation
- `tab` - Switch between preview tab and diff tab
- `q` - Quit the application
- `shift-↓/↑` - scroll in diff view

Profiles let you define multiple named program configurations and switch between them when creating a new session. When more than one profile is defined, the session creation overlay shows a profile picker that you can navigate with `←`/`→`.

| Field     | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | Display name shown in the profile picker                 |
| `program` | Shell command used to launch the agent for that profile  |

#### Failed to start new session

If you get an error like `failed to start new session: timed out waiting for tmux session`, update the
underlying program (ex. `claude`) to the latest version.

1. **tmux** to create isolated terminal sessions for each agent
2. **git worktrees** to isolate codebases so each session works on its own branch
3. A simple TUI interface for easy navigation and management
