**the runtime your coding agents live on.**

- **detach without stopping work** — herdr keeps terminals running in a background server when you close the client or lose your SSH connection. after a server or machine restart, herdr restores the saved layout and can resume supported agent sessions; the original processes do not survive. [session state →](https://herdr.dev/docs/session-state/)
- **several machines, one window** — keep local work and saved ssh machines together, with a combined agent list and independent reconnects. [remote machines →](https://herdr.dev/docs/connecting-machines/)
- **never hunt for the stuck one** — every pane is marked working, blocked, or idle. when an agent stops and needs an answer, herdr says so.
- **agent-native** — agents drive herdr through the cli and socket api: they can spawn panes, prompt each other, and wait until another agent is genuinely blocked. [agent skill →](https://herdr.dev/docs/agent-skill/)
- **runs what you already run** — claude code, codex, cursor, opencode, grok and the rest. herdr doesn't wrap or replace them; it owns their terminals. building an agent? [add herdr support →](https://herdr.dev/docs/add-herdr-support/)
- **keyboard and mouse, both first-class** — tmux-style prefix keys *and* click, drag, split. pick per moment, not per tool.
- **plugins** — extend panes and workflows. [browse the marketplace →](https://herdr.dev/plugins/)
- **one rust binary, no electron** — runs in whatever terminal you already use.

run your agents, split panes, walk away. `ctrl+b q` detaches, `herdr` reattaches. [quick start →](https://herdr.dev/docs/quick-start/)
